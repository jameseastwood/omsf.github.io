### OMSF Symposium 2024

OMSF Symposium 2024 was in Leiden, NL. It was fantastic to see our community gathered under one roof, especially one as beautiful as [Naturalis](https://www.naturalis.nl/) - an unforgettable experience!

If you missed the event this year or want to revisit it, we now have photos and videos available! The symposium featured a blend of keynote presentations, partner presentations, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on project demos from leading initiatives like Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, and OpenFold.
